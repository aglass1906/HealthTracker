# Family Features Guide

The **Family** tab is the social hub of the HealthTracker app. It allows you to create groups, compete with friends and family, and track each other's progress.

## 1. Getting Started
When you first open the Family tab, you have two options:
*   **Create New Family**: Enter a name (e.g., "The Glass Family") to start a new group. You will become the first member.
*   **Join a Family**: Enter the **6-digit Invite Code** shared by a family member to join an existing group.

## 2. The Dashboard
Once you are in a family, you will see three main sections:

### A. Feed 📰
A scrolling timeline of recent activity.
*   **Automatic Updates**: You don't need to post anything! The system automatically creates a post when:
    *   🏃 **Workouts**: You verify a workout in Apple Health (e.g., "Finished a 30m Run").
    *   🎯 **Goals**: You hit 10,000 steps or close your rings.
    *   🔥 **Streaks**: You hit a 3-day or 7-day streak (coming soon).
*   **Format**: "Dad finished a workout! 💪 (2h ago)"
*   **Purpose**: Encouragement and high-fives. No manual posting required.

### B. Leaderboard 🏆
A daily ranking of who is most active *today*.
*   **How it Works**: The app takes a snapshot of everyone's "Steps Today" from Apple Health and uploads it to the family cloud.
*   **The Race**: The list is sorted by **Steps** in descending order.
*   **Visual Progress**: The golden ring around the #1 player is 100%. Everyone else has a blue ring showing their percentage relative to the leader (e.g., if the leader has 10k steps and you have 5k, your ring is 50% full).
*   **Daily Reset**: The board resets automatically at **midnight** in your local time zone. Every morning is a fresh start!

### C. Members & Admin 👥
Manage the group and invite others.
*   **Everyone is an Admin**: We believe in trust! Any family member can see the **Invite Code** and share it with others.
*   **The Invite Code**: This 6-digit code (e.g., `123456`) is unique to your family group and **does not expire**. You can write it on the fridge or text it to a cousin.
*   **Joining**: New members simply type in the code during setup to instantly sync with the group.
*   **Leaving**: Changing families? Just tap "Leave Family" at the bottom of the list. This removes you from the leaderboard and feed effectively immediately.

## 3. How Data is Shared
*   **Privacy First**: The app only shares your *daily totals* (Steps, Calories, etc.). It does **not** share your location, heart rate, or minute-by-minute activity.
*   **Syncing**: Data is synced automatically when you open the app. If the leaderboard looks out of date, pull down to refresh!

# Profile Screen Guide

This document explains the features available on the Profile screen of the HealthTracker app.

### 1. Connection Status (Top)
*   **Health Tracker**: Shows if the app is currently allowed to talk to Apple Health (`Connected` or `Not Connected`).

### 2. Health Data Controls
*   **HealthKit Authorized**: A green checkmark means everything is working correctly.
*   **Import Last 30 Days**: Tapping this tells the app to go back in time and grab your health stats for the past month. This is useful when you first install the app.
*   **Sync Latest Data**: This forces an immediate check for *just today's* fresh numbers.
*   **Unauthorize HealthKit**: This disconnects the app from Apple Health and stops tracking.

### 3. Account Management (Bottom)
*   **Sign Out**: Logs you out of the app.
*   **Signed in as...**: Shows the email address of the currently logged-in user, so you know which account's data you are looking at.
